<h1>HWFEditor</h1>
<p>HWFEditor is an asset editing tool developed for editing the <code>MidiJam.HWF</code> asset file included with the
    MIDIJam package. <i>This program will not work on other HWF files created in Scott's other games.</i></p>
<h2>Using HWFEditor</h2>
<p>To use this program, you must already have an existing MidiJam.HWF file to edit. Copies of the MIDIJam package
    include this file and can be edited. To begin editing the file, click <b>File | Open...</b> and select the file.
    Once the file has been loaded, you can begin making changes to it.</p>
<p>In the large panel, all textures, including their names, sizes, and a preview, is shown. The list of 3D models and
    their sizes are shown in the "Model" tab.</p>
<p>The easiest way to edit assets is to export them all to a dedicated folder, edit them, then reimport them all. To do
    this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click <b>File | Export...</b>, then press Ctrl + A to select all assets, then <b>Export</b> to export them to a
        folder.
    </li>
    <li>Make any edits to the assets with whichever program you want. <i>Note: Textures must keep their original aspect
        ratio, otherwise MIDIJam will crash.</i></li>
    <li>Click <b>File | Import...</b>, and select all the assets to import them.</li>
    <li>Click <b>File | Save</b> to overwrite the HWF file.</li>
</ul>
